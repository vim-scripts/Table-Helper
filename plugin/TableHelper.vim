" Description: Plugin to easily align text in columns (to make tables).
"
" Version 2.0:
"
" When calling Gettabstopsfromcurrentline, the last column size is set to the larger of the value of g:TableHelper_lastColumnSize or the length of the text in
" the last column being measured. The very last column of text isn't truncated (unless lines with more columns than measured show up), but this value is used
" when generating separator lines.
"
" Added some commands:
"
" Aligntable: given a range of lines (visually selected, for example), will automatically figure out the optimum layout. Takes optional arguments: the column
" alignments (see Setcolumnalignments) and the amount by which the table should be indented. (If not specified, all alignments take the defaults as specified
" for Setcolumnalignments and the indent becomes the indentation of the first line in the range).
"
" To specify just an indent, pass in 'l' for the first argument (that's the default and all values get left-aligned anyway).

" As an example, the following table
"
" First name            Last name               Age
" ------  -----  -----
" John   Smith   28
" Jane             Doe          32
"
" can be selected visually and Aligntable executed to get (with a default column margin value of 2):
"
" First name  Last name  Age
" ------      -----      -----
" John        Smith      28
" Jane        Doe        32
"
" Executing with a column margin of 10, on the other hand, gives:
"
" First name          Last name          Age
" ------              -----              -----
" John                Smith              28
" Jane                Doe                32
"
" The column positions used are stored (clobbering any previous calls to Gettabstopsfromcurrentline) so new lines may be added to this table and reformatted
" quickly using the standard reformatting hotkey.
"
" Addseparatorline: adds a separator line just below the current cursor line. If the tab stops are from this line
"
" First name          Last name          Age
"
" then executing "Addseparatorline" with the cursor on the line itself gives

" Addseparatorline
" ------------------  -----------------  ----------
"
" The space between separators is determined by g:TableHelper_columnMargin.
"
" The command takes these arguments, all optional (with default values):
"
" Addseparatorline [continuous=0] [separator characters=g:TableHelper_separatorCharacters]
"
" The first argument is whether to generate a continuous line (defaults to 0) or one with breaks at the column margins:
"
" Addseparatorline 0 -=
" -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=  -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-  -=-=-=-=-=
"
" Addseparatorline 1 -=+
" -=+-=+-=+-=+-=+-=+-=+-=+-=+-=+-=+-=+-=+-=+-=+-=+-
"
" And the second determines the separators to use for this line.
"
" Addseparatorline 1 :-
" :-:-:-:-:-:-:-:-:-:-:-:-:-:-:-:-:-:-:-:-:-:-:-:-:
"
" Setcolumnalignments: Takes a string consisting of an arbitrary number of 'l' (left), 'c' (center) and 'r' (right); for example, 'llrlc'. When reformatting a
" line or calling Aligntable, this value is taken into consideration for how to align the value in a particular column. Thus, 'llrlc' means that the first
" two columns will be left-aligned, the third will be right-aligned, and then left and, finally, the last column will be centered in the allocated space.
"
" If the table contains more columns than specified in the alignment, the remaining columns are all left-aligned ('l'). Column values that are too long (doesn't
" happen when Aligntable is called unless the lines are added after the fact) end up being left-aligned (or truncated, in which case they fill up the entire
" column and alignment doesn't enter into it).
"
" The alignments are stored on a per-buffer basis (just like the table column stops).
"
" New options:
"
" g:TableHelper_lastColumnSize (default 10): used for adding separator lines; specifies the minimum length for the last column
"
" g:TableHelper_separatorCharacters (default '-'): the character string that the separator comprises; gets repeated and truncated as necessary and starts over
" every time there is a column break (repeats continuously if no break is chosen)
"
" Version 1.0:
"
" Initial version.
"
" This plugin helps with aligning text in columns, making the creation of tables easier. The process is simple:
"
" 1. Manually lay out one line of the table (the header, for example) and execute the command Gettabstopsfromcurrentline (there is a hotkey, in case you do this
" often) to have it parse the line and save the column definitions (per buffer).
"
" 2. Go to any other lines that are supposed to be in the table and either hit the hotkey on them one by one or visually select a range and hit the hotkey and
" they will all get realigned to match the header row.
"
" Caveat: these example may look horribly aligned if viewed with a proportional font.
"
" For example, given these three rows of text:
"
" First name            Last name               Age
" ------  -----  -----
" John   Smith   28
" Jane             Doe          32
"
" If the first line is the one parsed for the columns, hitting the hotkey on the remaining lines yields:
"
" First name            Last name               Age
" ------                -----                   -----
" John                  Smith                   28
" Jane                  Doe                     32
"
" If you parse the last line instead you get this:
"
" First name       Last name    Age
" ------           -----        -----
" John             Smith        28
" Jane             Doe          32
"
" If you have the repeat.vim autoload plugin installed, the reformatting is repeatable on other lines.
"
" Requirements: the column text has to be separated by at least 2 spaces, both for the header line and for each line that is to be reformatted. For example:
"
" First name  Last name  Age
"
" Defines three columns, as does:
"
" First name          Last name            Age
"
" Options:
"
" g:TableHelper_truncateLongEntries (default 0): occasionally, you might have an entry in a table that is too long (say, you allocated 10 spaces for a column in
" the header but the text is actually 12 characters). This option determines how that is handled:
"
" - If 1, the entry gets truncated to fit. You will lose data, but the table will still line up (small price to pay!)
"
" - If 0, the entry is put in as is and allowed to comprise as many columns as needed. The rest of the text is simply aligned to the next column. You will
"   retain all your data, but will lose formatting.
"
" In practice, you should probably leave this value at 0. If you see misalignments, adjust your header row, recalculate the column stops, visually select your
" table and hit the hotkey and the whole thing will be realigned. If you start truncating fields, your only recourse will be the undo (u) key. (I only put this
" option in at all because it was fairly easy to implement the truncation!)
"
" g:TableHelper_columnMargin (default 2): how much space must there be between the end of one column's text and the start of the next before it's considered too
" long a column. Typically, you have to have some space between adjacent columns (or else, how can you tell where one column ends and the next begins). For
" example, if your header row and first row of data look like this:
"
" FName    LName  Age
" Jonathan  Smythe  28
"
" During reformat, the first column will be considered too long because there wouldn't be 2 spaces between Jonathan and Smythe (assuming
" g:TableHelper_columnMargin is set to 2--you can set it higher to get more space between columns). Thus, if you have truncation enabled
" (g:TableHelper_truncateLongEntries is 1), you'll get this:
"
" FName    LName  Age
" Jonatha  Smyth  28
"
" As it happens, the last name was too long, also. If you don't have truncation enabled, you get this:
"
" FName    LName  Age
" Jonathan        Smythe  28
"
" "Smythe" simply gets pushed under the next available column and then, since the number of header columns runs out, subsequent columns of text are simply
" placed as is, separated by g:TableHelper_columnMargin spaces.
"
" This plugin requires at least two spaces between columns to be able to recognize them as distinct columns, so a value less than 2, while supported, will
" seriously jeopardize any attempts to reformat the table as all the text will run together (try setting it to 0...). If someone complains, I can force 2 as the
" minimum.
"
" If you have my getVar.vim, then you can set these options on a per window, buffer or tab basis, also. (Otherwise, only on a global basis).
"
" Commands:
"
" Gettabstopsfromcurrentline: parses the current line for columns; probably best to call this from your header line, though you could also call it from the
" longest line in your table (and then use the alignment hotkey to have the header conform to this, also).
"
" Retabline: Reformats the specified lines (visually selected or the current line) so they conform to the previously specified header line.
"
" Showtabstops: Displays the list of tab stops currently defined, if any.
"
" Mappings:
"
" <Plug>TableHelper_Gettabstopsfromcurrentline: executes Gettabstopsfromcurrentline (defaults to <leader><c-t>)
"
" <Plug>TableHelper_Retabline: executes Retabline (defaults to <c-t>). May be called again after changing the truncation or column margin options to change the
" alignment of already formatted lines.
"
" The default hotkeys may be overridden in your vimrc.
"
" Tip: if you call Gettabstopsfromcurrentline on an empty line, you get no column definitions; then, when you try to reformat a line, it just ends up having the
" columns of text displayed in their entirety, separated by g:TableHelper_columnMargin spaces. For example, if g:TableHelper_columnMargin is 5, this line
"
" Jonathan                    Smythe  28
"
" becomes
"
" Jonathan     Smythe     28
"
" This might be useful for first laying out the longest line in the table, calling Gettabstopsfromcurrentline on it and then reformatting the entire table based
" on those column markers:
"
" FName        LName      Age
" -----        -----      ---
" Jonathan     Smythe     28
" Jon          Smith      32
"
" TODO: If there is interest, I could write a command to lay out a line with those spaces, ignoring column specifications to make it easier to lay a table out.
